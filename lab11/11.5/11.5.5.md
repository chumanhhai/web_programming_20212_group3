  interface, `XUL` has been created for interface of applications. `XUL` was defined to build the user interface of the

- `EPUB`: internally uses `XHTML` or `DTBook` (an `XML` standard provided by the `DAISY` Consortium) to represent the
  text and structure of the content document, and a subset of `CSS` to provide layout and formatting. `XML` is used to
  create the document manifest, table of contents, and `EPUB` metadata.
- `ATOM`: Atom was designed to be a universal publishing standard for blogs and other Websites where content is updated
  frequently. Users visiting a website with an Atom feed can discover a file described as `atom.xml` in the `URL` that
